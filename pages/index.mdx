# Skylar K

I'm a software engineer and hobby game developer who is seeking full-time work. I've been making games for most of my life, but rarely do I get a chance to really show what I've done, so I've put together this little portfolio.  I will be updating this page with progress on my current project, and occasionally showing off old unfinished projects if they are presentable enough.

I'm currently seeking work in game development, software development, web development, customer support, or QA testing. Regardless of any roles or opportunities I might find I will continue to work on games I am passionate about, as it is my life long dream to release games that other people can appreciate and enjoy. I strongly believe that a good video game can get people through some of the most difficult times in life, bring people together over a shared interest, and inspire creativity in others, and it's my wish to bring that to as many people as I can.

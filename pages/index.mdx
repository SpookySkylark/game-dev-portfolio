# Skylar K

I'm a software engineer and hobby game developer who is seeking full-time work. I've been making games for most of my life, but rarely do I get a chance to really show what I've done, so I've put together this little portfolio.  I will be updating this page with progress on my current project, and occasionally showing off old unfinished projects if they are presentable enough.

This portfolio is still a major work in progress! It will be expanded upon in the future, and some articles are still being written and checked.

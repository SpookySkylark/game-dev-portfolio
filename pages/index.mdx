# Skylar K

I'm a software engineer and hobby game developer who is seeking full time work.

I've put together this small portfolio to show case some past projects, and will updating this page with progress on my current project.

This portfolio is still a work in progress! It will be expanded further in the near future, but currently everything in placeholder.

# Unnamed Space Co-op RPG

I've put a pause of Skeleton Smasher development to move on to larger and more ambitious project. I've always been a huge fan of RPG elements, stats, skills, and levels, and making perks and designing classes is a major reason I am so drawn to game development. With that n mind I've started work on a an online co-op space RPG. The main gameplay loop is intended to feel like a dungeon crawl, working through rooms with enemies to collect loot. As a huge fan of "the trilogy" I intend to implement it as well, by having at least one class that is a Tank and one that is a Healer.

The game is currently in the early stages, however connection tests have been successful and a save system has been implemented. Players can see each other and enemies and most things are synchronized already. However the graphics are still very limited and there is nothing much to show at this point, as most work is going into base systems and online functionality, which does not make for exciting pictures. 

While I currently have no time frame for a release, I hope to have something basic playable within the next few months.
